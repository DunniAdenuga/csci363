Comments: Good work!
P1.1: Very good!
P1.2: Very good!
P2: Very good!
P3.1: Very good! Where you said "the general webpage acted as the server" really should be just "web server." Pages don't act as a server.
P3.2: Very good!

5/8 P1: The basic function works. But the client results in "segmentation fault"

Segmentation fault
[xmeng@polaris lab02]$ 
------------------------------------------------------------
I think the reason for the seg fault is that you didn't terminate the string after readn(s, buf, size). You should have done after the readn() the following.
buf[size] = 0;

In addition, it seems that the fortune server always returns one fix piece of fortune.

5/6 P2: Very good, though the same seg fault issue exists.

6/6 P3: Good!

Comments: Thank you for the re-submission. Your list-sender/receiver works in part. See the output that I copied below. Your answer to Probelm 3.1 is not quite to the point. The UDP length field is a 16-bit unit. You answered that part correctly, 2^16 - 1 or 65535, is the maximum value. But why 65527? The reason is that UDP header takes up 8 bytes, thus, the data portion is at most 65535 - 8 = 65527. 

I updated the grade for your answer for P 3.1 and 3.2
4/6 P 1
    P 1.1: Good.
    P 1.2: Good.
    P 1.3: It is better to use sizeof(struct node_t) instead of a constant 288.
    P 1.4: How do you read the node from the receiving side?
    In addition, the program pair list-sender.c and list-receiver.c do not work correctly. Part of the reason is you didn't set the field nodeList->len correctly.

5/6 P 2: While the program and results are correct, you should have included a copy of the screen output in your answers.txt.
Updated P 2: 6/6 Thank you the submitted screen shot. You could've just recorded text.

5/8 P 3: You didn't answer questions P 3.1 and 3.2.
Updated P 3 grade: 7/8

Comments: Good work in general. However you didn't turn off the echo on the client side so that your password is echoed while being typed.
