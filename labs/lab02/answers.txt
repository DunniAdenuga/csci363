From the server:
 That’s why I can’t take sides on this issue and I’m not going to. But every
working software developer should understand, at least, how standards work,
how standards should work, how we got into this mess, so I want to try to
explain a little bit about the problem here, and you’ll see that it’s the same
reason Microsoft Vista is selling so poorly, and it’s the same issue I wrote
about when I referred to the Raymond Chen camp (pragmatists) at Microsoft vs.
the MSDN camp (idealists), the MSDN camp having won, and now nobody can figure
out where their favorite menu commands went in Microsoft Office 2007, and
nobody wants Vista, and it’s all the same debate: whether you are an Idealist
(”red”) or a Pragmatist (”blue”).
