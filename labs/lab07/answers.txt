Raw  sockets  allow new IPv4 protocols to be implemented in user space.
       A raw socket receives or sends the  raw  datagram  not  including  link
       level headers.
tcp_socket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
       udp_socket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0);
       raw_socket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_RAW, protocol);
This means raw sockets are usually only needed for new
       protocols or protocols with no user interface (like ICMP).

Traceroute Questions

1. SOCK_RAW is a macro which when specified tells lets the socket application create raw sockets. IPROTO_ICMP is a type of protocol that can be used when creating a raw socket so, ICMP can be directly accessed.
SOCK_RAW creates raw sockets while SOCK_DGRAM creates udp sockets and SOCK_STREAM creates tcp sockets. Also, SOCK_RAW is more low-level compared to SOCK_STREAM and SOCK_DGRAM.

2. ip_hdr now points to whatever memory location buf was pointing to. The memory address of the variable ip_hdr is its previous memory address but it now contains buf's address .

3. On a local machine, it says it cannot set HDRINCL. 
IP_HDRINCL indicates if the ip header is included else the IPv4 layer generates one.
Yes. The ip header is created in the while loop.

4. inet_pton(int af, const char *src, void *dst);
This  function converts the character string src into a network address
       structure in the af address family, then  copies  the  network  address
       structure  to dst.
5. csum() calculates the checksum. The 
The data it's used for is the ip header.

6. The icmp_header now points to 20 spots after buf[0]'s address.
It's (buf + 20) because the first 20 spaces are occupied by the ip header.

7. ICMP_ECHO = 8
code 0 has a different meaning depending on the type.
For example:
TYPE = 0 - Echo Reply sent by:
code 0 = (no special meaning) host, router
TYPE = 3 - Destination Unreachable sent by:
code 0 = network unreachable router
TYPE = 4 - Source Quench sent by:
code 0 = datagram could not be received host, router or routed

For this type 8, code 0 means No code.

8. It means Echo reply.
type 11: It means the time exceeded.

9.char *inet_ntoa(struct in_addr inp);
 The  inet_ntoa()  function converts the Internet host address inp, given in network byte order, to a string  in  IPv4  dotted-decimal  notation. 
It returns a string value of IPv4 dotted-decimal notation of the parameter addr2.sin_addr, which is in network byte order.


Ping Questions

1. How the ICMP packet information is encapsulated in the IP packet.
Have a generic buffer *buf. First few bytes stores the ip_header and some other bytes store the icmp_header.

2.Which part of the program is responsible for periodically sending ICMP packet and how the timing is controlled.
The sendto() function in the sendping file. If timing is enabled, we use gettimeofday to get the current time. 

 3.Which part of the program is responsible for receiving the packet as the result of ping.
The recv_ping() function from the recv_ping.c file.

4.Where and how the ICMP packet is built.
The icmp packet is built in the sendping.c file by creating a struct icmp variable and assigning values to its members then it's sent.

5.How the round trip time is computed.
The current time at the time the packet is to be sent is gotten using gettimeofday and stored in icmp_data and the current time when we call pr_pack is gotten from gettimeofday too. Then, we subtract and calculate the round trip time using formula triptime = tv.tv_sec * 1000 + ((double)tv.tv_usec / 1000);
